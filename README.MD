This is a project to attempt reading from a EpSolar 4210AN. This project will be
using the ELog01 as the serail to USB Converter.  It is intended to be run on a
Raspberry PI 3 B+

Currently it requires libmodbus5 and libmodbus-dev.  Later it will use mysql and
other libraries.

This will likely work with any products that can use an mt-50 as they will be
using the same protocol.
